# Python-Server-Examples
This is just sample code that aims to simply serve as an example that will help people conceptualize the client/server concept.
Plus perhaps be a good working concept for people that know about it, but are too lazy to code something up themselve.

The 'main1' file is just a little concept code for a database type thing that could work with this sample code.
Plus also, to be honest; had no idea where else it would go.

In any case: hope it all helps.


(Available in both python and python 3).
